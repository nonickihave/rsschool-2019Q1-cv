2. **Contacts**:
    1. Phone No: +375 29 556 94 07
    2. Addr:  Mstislavtsa str, 24-61
3. **Summary**: <br />
My main intention is to structure knowledge I already have and to acquire some more. <br />
It would be an ideal point to acquire a developer position at EPAM :relieved: <br />
What's important to me in this context is to be a member of a team where the development process is clear and I have chances to grow further. <br />
I'm keen on self-learning and actually trying to apply this approach where it's possible <br />
Below are some examples:
    * Car driving <br />
    Some time ago I got my driving license and my first car. Now I have a plan how to master my driving skills
    * Programming learning <br />
    I also have a plan to work on my development skills. It's **not** a simple idea, e.g. "I want to know this and this". I'm going to implement some concepts of self-learning
    * Finally, I have some ideas how to teach. So maybe it'll make sense for RSSchool :smirk:
4. **Skills**:
    * JS
    * Java SE/EE/8
    * HTML/CSS
    * Scrum, Git, Linux Bash scripting, php, Eclipse, JetBrains WebStorm, Jira, RTC, MoDX REVO, SQL, Hibernate, JPA, LIferay
5. Some code examples in context of JS can be found [there] (https://github.com/nonickihave/2019_js_course_love_triangle/blob/master/src/index.js)
  If you want some code examples from my prev projects, let's discuss that in an interview
6. **Experience**
    * _Java_ - 3 years (Traffic Light control system, Railway Dispatcher, Liferay Portal Project)
    * _JS_ - 1,5 years (chrome extensions imitating human behavior) (not available online)
    * _Php_ - 1 year (arabic news portal) https://www.eremnews.com/
    * _Projects_: *Notice*: actually I've participated in various projects not related to development itself. As an example, ETL projects.
7. **Education**
    *  BSUIR, Faculty of Informational Technologies and Management;
    *  Requirements management course
    *  RSSchool (2019) :)

8. **English**: Upper intermediate <br />
 As of now, I've participated in more than three projects requiring English:
    1. About 8 months on EREM news portal
    2. 2,6 months on an ETL (TSC) project
    3. One more German transformation project
